**Title:** Solving an Industrial-Scale Bus Route Finding in Public Transport Network using Modular Answer Set Programming

**Abstract:** Finding user-satisfied bus routes subject to the minimal travel time and the number of route transfers is a challenging problem in transportation networks. In our context, bus routes and bus stations form a directed graph. Thus, a solution to finding the user-satisfied bus routes is a route path between two given stations satisfying a collection of different user’s constraints. While this problem could be related to existing research, such as, the study of graph traversal and path finding algorithms. We show that our problem is more suited to formalizing the navigation system in terms of an answer set programming (ASP) rather than solving the more common graph traversal problems such as the well-known Dijkstra’s algorithm, which only provides a statically single solution with lowest cost. An empirical evaluation on a real-world bus network shows how well our ASP encoding works in producing a wide range of high-quality solutions that explore the trade-off between the two optimization criteria, all the while keeping Dijkstra’s result as a point of comparison. The findings show promise for extending to richer transit representations and optimization objectives beyond the two considered here.
